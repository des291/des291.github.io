    <button type="button" class="collapsible">&gt; Black hole: First picture of Milky Way monster</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>It's their second such image after releasing in 2019 a picture of the giant black hole at the heart of
            another galaxy
            called Messier 87, or M87. That object was more than a thousand times bigger at 6.5 billion times the mass
            of our
            Sun."But this new image is special because it's our supermassive black hole," said Prof Heino Falcke, one of
            the
            European pioneers behind the EHT project.</p>
        <p>"Because Sagittarius A* is a much smaller black hole - it's around a 1,000 times smaller - its ring structure
            changes on
            timescales that are a 1,000 times faster," explained team member Dr Ziri Younsi from University College
            London, UK.
            "It's very dynamic. The 'hotspots' you see in the ring move around from day to day."</p>
        <p>The super-heated, excited gas - or plasma - in the ring is travelling around the black hole at a significant
            fraction of
            light-speed.</p>
        <p>Scientists have already begun to deploy the measurements in the new image to test the physics we currently
            use to
            describe black holes.</p>
        <p>The new super space telescope, James Webb, will turn its eye on Sgr A*. The $10bn observatory won't have the
            resolution
            to directly image the black hole and its accretion ring, but it will bring new capability to the study of
            the
            environment around the black hole with its incredibly sensitive infrared instruments.</p>
        <p>Astronomers will be studying in unprecedented detail the behaviour and the physics of hundreds of stars
            whipping around
            the black hole.</p>
        <p>They'll even be looking to see if there are some star-sized black holes in the region, and for evidence of
            concentrated
            clumps of invisible, or dark, matter.</p>
